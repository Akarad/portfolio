        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I currently hold a bachelor's degree in Accounting and have a wealth of experience of 7 years within Safaricom PLC where i support the Enterprise Channels team on Fixed data services. I was inspired to learn to learn programming, after my involvement in a global coding challenge called Technovation which i have supported since early 2018. When it comes to careers, I believe that it is never too late to pursue your passion, which for me right now is Digital IT.</p>
